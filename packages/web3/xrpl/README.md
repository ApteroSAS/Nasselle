# Nasselle x XRP Repository

This repository contains the foundational integration for Nasselle with XRP Ledger and XRPL EVM Sidechain.

Nasselle’s Web3 strategy leverages decentralized technologies to empower users with full control over their data and computing resources. Built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for fast, low-cost transactions and tokenization, and integrating the XRPL EVM Sidechain for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, Nasselle delivers automation, rewards, and staking functionality. The project is designed to foster interoperability across blockchains, offering tokenized storage and compute power with secure, decentralized identity (DID) and a transparent ledger for ecosystem interactions.

Key XRPL features include Automated Market Makers (AMMs) for dynamic pricing, cross-chain bridges for interoperability, and Ripple’s suite of tools like RLUSD Stablecoin, Ripple Custody, and Ripple Payments for a robust and user-friendly ecosystem.
