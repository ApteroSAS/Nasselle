# More on the Web 3 Nasselle

This repository contains the foundational integration for Nasselle with XRP Ledger and XRPL EVM Sidechain.

Nasselle’s Web3 strategy leverages decentralized technologies to empower users with full control over their data and computing resources. Built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for fast, low-cost transactions and tokenization, and integrating the XRPL EVM Sidechain for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, Nasselle delivers automation, rewards, and staking functionality. The project is designed to foster interoperability across blockchains, offering tokenized storage and compute power with secure, decentralized identity (DID) and a transparent ledger for ecosystem interactions.  


## In more details
We're building Decentralized Cloud Storage and Compute Solutions with XRPL Integration

Nasselle redefines NAS (Network-Attached Storage) by introducing NAS as a Service (NaaS). Leveraging the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its EVM Sidechain, Nasselle empowers users to securely manage their data, run applications, and access a Virtual NAS in the cloud—all while benefiting from the speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability of decentralized technologies.  

- What Makes Nasselle Unique?
Built on XRP Ledger:  
Nasselle utilizes XRPL for fast, low-cost, and transparent transactions, enabling seamless resource sharing and payments across its ecosystem.

- Virtual NAS (vNAS):  
Provides a fully cloud-based NAS solution that eliminates the need for physical hardware, making it accessible, scalable, and secure for anyone.

- Decentralized Resource Marketplace:  
Users can tokenize and trade storage or compute resources, creating a dynamic ecosystem driven by XRPL’s efficiency and smart contracts.

#### Secure and Addressable:
Combine data sovereignty with advanced encryption to ensure your storage and applications are always safe and accessible.

- How XRP Enhances Nasselle  
Low-Cost Transactions: Manage payments for storage and compute power without the high fees associated with traditional cloud providers.
Smart Contracts: Use XRPL EVM Sidechain for automation, staking, rewards, and marketplace operations.
Tokenization: Transform storage and compute resources into tradeable tokens, enabling a decentralized economy.
Interoperability: Bridges with Ethereum and Polygon expand Nasselle’s capabilities and user base.
